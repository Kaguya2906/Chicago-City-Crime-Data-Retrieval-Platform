# Cost Analysis #

An integral part of managing any data-driven project is understanding and optimizing for cost, especially when dealing with scalable solutions that handle large amounts of data and traffic. For this project, we've utilized a suite of AWS services to ensure that our ETL pipeline and data warehouse are not only scalable but also cost-effective.

## 1 Estimated AWS Service Costs ##

Below is a breakdown of the AWS services we've integrated, along with their respective monthly costs:

### 1.1 Amazon API Gateway: At the core of our application, the API Gateway acts as the entry point for our services, enabling seamless data access and integration. Monthly Cost: $60

### 1.2 AWS CodePipeline: To ensure continuous integration and delivery, AWS CodePipeline automates our deployment workflows, enhancing our productivity and reliability. Monthly Cost: $50

### 1.3 Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility): Chosen for its compatibility with MongoDB, DocumentDB offers a scalable, high-performance database solution for managing our document-based data structures. Monthly Cost: $500

These services have been chosen for their ability to scale and handle the load generated by the Chicago Crime Reports dataset, providing a robust and reliable backend for our analytical platform.

## 2 Total Monthly Cost ##

Utilizing the AWS Pricing Calculator, we have estimated that the total cost for these services will be approximately $610 per month. This estimation gives us a transparent overview of our operational expenses and allows us to plan our budget accordingly.

## 3 Cost Optimization Strategies ##

In deploying these AWS services, we have applied the following strategies to optimize for cost:

### 3.1 Resource Scaling: By closely monitoring demand, we scale our resources up or down to ensure that we are only paying for what we use.
### 3.2 Budget Alarms: AWS Budgets are configured to alert us if cost or usage exceeds our predefined budget threshold, preventing unexpected expenses.
### 3.3 Reserved Instances: Where appropriate, we use reserved instances for services like DocumentDB, which can offer significant savings over on-demand pricing.

By maintaining this balance between cost and performance, we ensure that our platform is not only effective in crime data analysis but also remains economically viable.
